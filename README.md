#### Tool: Jupyter Notebook (Python3, Panda)

#### Objective: To create a model that predicts the probability of the desired outcome, in this case, the likelihood of surviving the crash of the Titanic Spaceship.

#### Description: The Examples.html file is a shared database of commands and processes used for the next two. Since it is necessary to have clean data when forecasting, a certain number of filters, cleaning, and data transformations take place to create a competent forecast, which happens in the Full Version Project Spaceship Titanic.html file. The Presentation Spaceship Titanic.pptx file demonstrates several excerpts from this process.
